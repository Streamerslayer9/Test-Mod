/**
 * The ways a villager earns XP besides comforting (that one lives in VillagerHolding). All of them are server side,
 * only ever for living ADULT villagers (McaIntegration.isAdultVillager checks MCA's age every time), and together they are
 * limited to mcaVillagerXpDailyCap XP per villager per Minecraft day (see VillagerHolding.addXp).
 *
 *   Talking: right-clicking a villager gives 2 XP, once every 5 minutes per villager and player.
 *   Gifts:   MCA's gift button uses the item in your hand and raises their hearts. So we remember what you held when you
 *            opened the villager, and if within a minute the item was used up and their hearts went up, that was a gift:
 *            3 XP, plus 1 for every 4 hearts it gave (at most 7 in all).
 *   Rides:   a soft ride in a stomach that ends with the villager let out gives 3 XP, plus 1 for every 30 seconds
 *            (at most 10 in all). Hard mode and digestion never give XP.
