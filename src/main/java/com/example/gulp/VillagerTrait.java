/**
 * A pred or prey villager's temper: SHY or CONFIDENT. Normal villagers have none (NONE) and act as before.
 * It comes from the villager's MCA personality (Shy, Sensitive, Gloomy, Grumpy = shy; Confident, Peppy, Athletic, Odd =
 * confident). Villagers with any other personality get one or the other from their UUID, so it never changes.
 * See McaIntegration.traitOf. The ordinal is what goes over the network (VillagerInfoPacket).
 *
 * Pred villagers (the ones who comfort you):
 *  CONFIDENT  offers sooner (under 60% HP), needs fewer hearts (80%), asks again sooner, heals 15% faster
 *  SHY        offers later (under 40% HP), needs more hearts (125%), asks again later, holds you 15% longer
 * Prey villagers use the trait to decide how often and how readily they ask to be carried (McaIntegration.tickAffection).
